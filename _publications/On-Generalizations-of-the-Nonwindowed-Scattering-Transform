title: "On Generalizations of the Nonwindowed Scattering Transform"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/Generalizations-of-the-Nonwindowed-Scattering-Transform
excerpt: 'In this paper, we provide results about the nonwindowed scattering transform, which we formulate as the q norm of a cascade of wavelet transforms and nonlinearities. The main result of this paper is a well-defined weighted measure with diffeomorphism stability properties akin to what is seen in the seminal paper, Group Invariant Scattering.'
