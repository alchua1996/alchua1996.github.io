excerpt: 'In this paper, we provide results about the nonwindowed scattering transform, which we formulate as the $q$ norm of a cascade of wavelet transforms and nonlinearities. The main result of this paper is a well-defined weighted measure with diffeomorphism stability properties akin to what is seen in the seminal paper, Group Invariant Scattering. Note that the downloadable version here has a slight patch in the proofs for general stability bounds. However, all the theorems still hold true.
