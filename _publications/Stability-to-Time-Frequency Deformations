collection: publications
permalink: files/Time_Frequency_Deformations_Deep_CNN.pdf?raw=true
venue: 'N/A - Accepted to ICASSP'
date: 2025-04-11
excerpt: 'In this paper, we examine deformations from the
lens of an operator similar to Fourier Integral Operators (FIOs).
First, we provide a generalization of the deformation operator
seen first in Mallatâ€™s seminal paper Group Invariant Scattering,
which we call a time-frequency deformation.'
