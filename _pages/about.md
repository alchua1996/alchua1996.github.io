My name is Albert, and this is my research website. I recieved my Ph.D. in Mathematics from Michigan State University, where I had the fortune to be advised by [Yang Yang](https://sites.google.com/view/dr-yang-yang/home) and [Matthew Hirn](https://matthewhirn.com). 

Research
======
Broadly speaking, I'm interested in the mathematics of machine learning/deep learning, with a slant towards interpreting feature extractors via techniques from Functional Analysis and Harmonic Analysis. The topics I've been working on recently include:
* Interpretable feature extractors (e.g. Wavelet Scattering Transforms)
* Wavelets
* Fourier Analysis
* Inverse Problems and Sampling

As a hobby, I also dabble with topics in Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition related to:
* Style Transfer
* Texture Synthesis
