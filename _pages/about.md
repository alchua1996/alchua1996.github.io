I am currently a part-time academic, who is *searching for opportunies in industry or academia.* I recieved my Ph.D. in Mathematics from Michigan State University, where I had the fortune to be advised by [Yang Yang](https://sites.google.com/view/dr-yang-yang/home) and [Matthew Hirn](https://matthewhirn.com). My research focuses on mathematical guarantees for nonwindowed scattering transforms, which are feature extractors using wavelets that resemble convolutional neural networks. I also dabble with other topics that I find interesting.
